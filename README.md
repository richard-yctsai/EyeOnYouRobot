Fusing Gesture Data from Video and Inertial Sensors for Person Identification

We are informed that our paper has been accepted for the presentation at IEEE In-ternational Conference on Robotics and Automation, May 21-25, 2018, Brisbane, Australia (ICRA 2018) and for inclusion in the conference proceedings.

Person identification (PID) is a key issue in many IoT, Robotic and Automation appli-cations. To enable reliable and remote PID, in this work, we present EOY (Eye On You), a data fusion approach that combines two kinds of sensors, a 3D depth cam-era and wearable sensors embedded with inertial measurement unit (IMU). Since these two kinds of data have common features, we are able to fuse them to conduct PID. 

To realize EOY, we develop fusion algorithms to address practical challenges, such as asynchronous timing and coordinate calibration. The experimental evalua-tion shows that EOY can achieve the recognition rate of 95% and is very robust even in crowded areas.
